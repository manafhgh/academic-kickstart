I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Colorado State
University](https://www.colostate.edu). I do my research as a member of the
[NetSec](https://www.netsec.colostate.edu/) Group under the supervision of
Prof. Christos Papadopoulos. (Expected graduation term is Spring 2020.)

I am broadly interested in Internet measurement research.  My Ph.D. work explored
leveraging delay measurement to characterize the visible IPv4 address space
locality and movement to enable efficient, continuous IP geolocation at an
Internet-wide scale. My work also explored devising a delay-based algorithm to
identify cellular networks.  In addition to measurement research, I'm also
interested in network security research. My previous work includes analyzing
large-scale NTP DDoS reflection-attacks (early 2014) and 
detecting abnormal activities prior to the DDoS attacks. I was also part of 
a work that identifies Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) -based botnets.

My teaching experience includes undergraduate-level teaching for four years prior to
joining the Ph.D. program at CSU.  My teaching experience also includes
serving as the teaching assistant for graduate-level courses in the computer
science department at CSU.
